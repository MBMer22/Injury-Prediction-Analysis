## Setting up my environment
Notes: Setting up my R environment by installing the following analysis packages
```{r install analysis packages}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("skimr")
install.packages("janitor")
install.packages("magrittr")
```

## Loading the required packages
Here, I loaded the previously installed packages
```{r load installed packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(magrittr)
```

## Upload and read csv for analysis
Here, I uploaded the injury_prediction csv and viewed the data frame
```{r upload and read csv}
injurypred <- read_csv("injury_data.csv")
head(injurypred)
str(injurypred)
```

## Fix any variables in data frame to match the csv
Here, I altered the data types to match the original csv
```{r mutate column data types}
injurypred <- injurypred %>%
  mutate(
    Player_Age = as.integer(Player_Age),
    Player_Weight = as.numeric(Player_Weight),
    Player_Height = as.numeric(Player_Height),
    Previous_Injuries = as.integer(Previous_Injuries),
    Training_Intensity = as.numeric(Training_Intensity),
    Recovery_Time = as.integer(Recovery_Time),
    Likelihood_of_Injury = as.integer(Likelihood_of_Injury)
  )
```

## Unit conversion
Here, I converted the Player weights from kg into lbs
```{r weight conversion}
injurypred$Player_Weight <- injurypred$Player_Weight * 2.20462
head(injurypred)
```

## Find the average player age, weight, and height
Here, I found the average player age, weight and height to build foundation
```{r calculate average age, weight, and height}
injurypred %>%
  summarise(average_age = mean(Player_Age, na.rm = TRUE))
injurypred %>% 
  summarise(average_weight = mean(Player_Weight, na.rm = TRUE))
injurypred %>% 
  summarise(average_height = mean(Player_Height, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Calculate the min and max player age, weight, and height
Here, I calculated the min and max
```{r min and max}
min(injurypred$Player_Age)
max(injurypred$Player_Age)
min(injurypred$Player_Weight)
max(injurypred$Player_Weight)
min(injurypred$Player_Height)
max(injurypred$Player_Height)
min(injurypred$Training_Intensity)
max(injurypred$Training_Intensity)
```

## Count total number of players with and without previous injuries
Here, I counted all players that do and do not have previous injuries 0=no, 1=yes
```{r count previous injuries}
table(injurypred$Previous_Injuries)
```

## Calculate total number of players older and younger that average age
Here, I added how many players were older and youger than the average age
```{r calculate player ages over and under avg age}
sum(injurypred$Player_Age > 28.2)
sum(injurypred$Player_Age < 28.2)
```

## Correlate relationship between age/weight and likelihood of injury
Here, I found a correlation between player age/weight and likelihood to get injured
```{r correlation_age_weight, echo=TRUE}
correlations <- injurypred %>%
  summarize(
    Age_vs_Injury = cor(Player_Age, Likelihood_of_Injury, use = "complete.obs"),
    Weight_vs_Injury = cor(Player_Weight, Likelihood_of_Injury, use = "complete.obs")
  )
print(correlations)
```

## Tabulate the likelihood of injury with a previous injury
Here, I found the likelihood of getting re injured
```{r tabulate likelihod}
table(injurypred$Previous_Injuries,injurypred$Likelihood_of_Injury)
```

## Compare likelihood of injury for different age groups
Here, I grouped the player ages and found the likelihood of injury for each group
```{r aggregate age groups}
injurypred$Age_Group <- cut(injurypred$Player_Age,breaks = c(18, 25, 30, 35, 39),
                            labels = c("18-25", "26-30", "31-35", "36-39"))
aggregate(Likelihood_of_Injury ~ Age_Group, data = injurypred, FUN = mean)
```

## Correlate the relationship between Training Intensity and Likelihood of Injury
Here, I found a correlation between training intensity and likelihood of injury
```{r correlation relationship}
cor(injurypred$Training_Intensity, injurypred$Likelihood_of_Injury, use = "complete.obs")
```

## Calculate average recovery time
Here, I grouped players by likelihood of injury and calculated average recovery time
```{r aggregate recovery time}
average_recovery_time <- injurypred %>% 
  group_by(Likelihood_of_Injury) %>% 
  summarize(average_recovery_time=mean(Recovery_Time,na.rm = TRUE))
print(average_recovery_time)
```

# Visualizations

## Player weight vs Previous Injuries
Here, I plotted the relationship between age and previous injuries
```{r ggplot previous injuries and weight}
ggplot(injurypred, aes(x = factor(Previous_Injuries), y = Player_Weight)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0) +
  labs(x = "Previous Injuries (0 = No, 1 = Yes)", y = "Player Weight") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Training intensity vs Recovery Time
Here, I plotted the relationship between intensity and recovery time
```{r ggplot training intensity and recovery time}
ggplot(injurypred, aes(x = factor(Recovery_Time), y = Training_Intensity)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0) +
  labs(x = "Recovery Time (days)", y = "Training Intensity") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Weight, Height, and likelihood of injury
Here, I plotted the relationship between weight, height, and likelihood of injury
```{r ggplot player weight, player height, likelihood of injury}
ggplot(injurypred, aes(x = Player_Weight, y = Player_Height, color = Likelihood_of_Injury)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot of Player Weight (lbs), Height, and Likelihood of Injury",
       x = "Player Weight (lbs)", y = "Player Height (cm)",
       color = "Likelihood of Injury") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Training Intensity and Likelihood of Injury for Players with previous injuries
Here, I plotted the relationship of training intensity vs likelihood of injury of players with previous injuries
```{r ggplot intensity, likelihood, previous injuries}
ggplot(injurypred, aes(x = Training_Intensity, y = Likelihood_of_Injury)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Training Intensity vs Likelihood of Injury for Players with Previous Injuries",
       x = "Training Intensity", y = "Likelihood of Injury") +
  theme_minimal()
```
